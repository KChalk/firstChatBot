# firstChatBot
These two files create an NLTK chat bot. The file bot.py imports the NLTK bot documented [here](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.chat.html#). The current version replies to user input using only predetermined responses as defined in pairs.py. Pairs.py combines responses written by serveral different sources, each of which is linked inline. The result is bit disturbing, as the bot randomly shifts personalities, from 'weeb' to psychotherapist, etc.
